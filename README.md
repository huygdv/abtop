# abtop

**Like [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), but for your AI coding agents.**

See every Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode session at a glance — token usage, context window %, rate limits, child processes, open ports, and more.
Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode sessions are discovered from local process/file state, so multiple active profiles are supported across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graykode/abtop/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Why

- Running 3+ agents across projects? See them all in one screen.
- Hitting rate limits? Watch your quota in real-time.
- Agent spawned a server and forgot to kill it? Orphan port detection.
- Context window filling up? Per-session % bars with warnings.

Monitoring is read-only until you use an explicit control such as `x` or `X`.
No API keys. No auth.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Linux, ensure `sqlite3` is installed to enable monitoring for OpenCode sessions.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.sh | sh
```

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install abtop
```

### Windows

Native support — no WSL required. Uses `sysinfo` for process info and host CPU/MEM metrics, and `netstat -ano` for listening ports. Windows has no load average, so LOAD is reported as 0. OpenCode session discovery additionally requires the `sqlite3` CLI (`winget install SQLite.SQLite`); without it abtop prints a one-time warning to stderr.

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Or `cargo install abtop` from any terminal with Git in PATH. Claude Code config is resolved automatically from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`.

### Other

Pre-built binaries for all platforms are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases) page.

## Usage

```bash
abtop                    # Launch TUI
abtop --once             # Print snapshot and exit
abtop --workspace-summary # Print redacted Workspace Markdown and exit
abtop --task-evidence    # Print redacted per-task evidence Markdown and exit
abtop --roadmap          # Print dependency-aware task roadmap Markdown and exit
abtop --handoff          # Print cross-agent assignment handoff Markdown and exit
abtop --handoff --json   # Print machine-readable handoff JSON and exit
abtop --setup            # Install rate limit collection hook
abtop --doctor           # Check local setup and collector health
abtop --doctor --json    # Print machine-readable diagnostics JSON
abtop --theme dracula    # Launch with a specific theme
abtop --mouse            # Enable mouse click/scroll navigation
```

Mutating controls require a second keypress within the confirmation window and
write append-only audit events to the local abtop data directory. Set
`ABTOP_AUDIT_FILE` to override the JSONL audit path, or set
`ABTOP_CONTROL_DRY_RUN=1` to audit verified controls without terminating
processes.

The Agentic Workspace surfaces (`--workspace-summary`, `--roadmap`, `--handoff`,
`--task-evidence`, plus the in-TUI Workspace tab) are documented under
[Agentic Workspace](#agentic-workspace) below. Production readiness checks live
in [`docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md). Known
limitations are listed in [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

Recommended terminal size: **120x40** or larger. Minimum 80x24 — panels hide gracefully when small.
Mouse capture is off by default so terminal drag selection and copy keep working. Launch with `--mouse` if you prefer click targets and wheel navigation.

Quota bars show account rate-limit percentage remaining for each provider
window. They are separate from the session token totals shown in the same panel.

### Terminal Jump

Press `Enter` to focus the terminal running the selected agent. abtop supports cmux, tmux, and iTerm2 on macOS.

```bash
tmux new -s work
# pane 0: abtop
# pane 1: claude (project A)
# pane 2: claude (project B)
# → Enter on a session in abtop jumps to its pane
```

## Agentic Workspace

When a project uses [dw-kit](https://github.com/dv-workflow/dw-kit) — or any
layout that mirrors `.dw/tasks/`, `.dw/decisions/`, `.dw/records/` — abtop
reads task state alongside live agent sessions. The same screen shows what is
running, which task it belongs to, what is ready next, and what is blocked.

Two or more agents (for example Claude Code and Codex) running against the
**same project directory** are merged into one Workspace project. They
coordinate through the shared task graph + evidence — not through a private
agent-to-agent chat. See `docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md` for the rationale.

### Prerequisites

- a `.dw/tasks/` directory in the project (v2 `spec.md`/`tracking.md` or legacy
  3-file layout — both parsed),
- at least one running Claude Code, Codex CLI, or OpenCode session inside that
  directory.

### Walkthrough

Open the TUI and press `a` to focus the Workspace tab:

```bash
abtop
# press `a` to focus Workspace
```

The Workspace tab shows: active task title, phase, acceptance/verification
counts, roadmap stages (ready/blocked/next), handoff lanes per agent, and
assignment suggestions.

For headless / scripted use, four redacted exports cover the same data:

```bash
abtop --workspace-summary    # Markdown — what is running, per project
abtop --roadmap              # Markdown — ready/blocked/staged tasks + risks
abtop --handoff              # Markdown — task assignment queue per agent
abtop --handoff --json       # JSON  — schema: abtop.agent_handoff.v1
abtop --task-evidence        # Markdown — per-task counts, tools, files, risks
abtop --dispatch-task <slug> --agent claude --dispatch-dry-run
                             # Headless composer: build brief, verify pipeline
```

Example (`--demo --handoff`, abbreviated):

```text
# abtop agent handoff

- coordination: shared workspace protocol
- handoff lanes: claude-code, codex-cli, opencode
- privacy: redacted task metadata only; no prompt text or file contents

## ml-pipeline
- active agents: claude
- ready now: 2
- blocked: 1
- assignment queue:
  - first stage 1: Dataset drift guardrails [Ready]
    suggested agent: implementation agent
    evidence: deps=0 verification=0/1
  - next stage 2: Model card refresh [Review]
    suggested agent: second agent reviewer
- do not assign yet:
  - blocked task: Production access approval
- live coordination notes:
  - claude wait: waiting for user input
```

Run any export with `--demo` to see synthetic data without a real session.

### Output Guarantees

All five Agentic Workspace surfaces:

- contain task titles, statuses, counts, and redacted tool labels only,
- never include prompt text, file contents, transcript bodies, or absolute
  local paths,
- can be piped into another tool or shared with a reviewer without further
  scrubbing.

`--handoff --json` carries a stable schema (`abtop.agent_handoff.v1`) suitable
as startup context for another agent.

### Dispatch composer (`d`)

When a `.dw` task is selected on the Workspace tab and at least one
`allow_dispatch_*` flag is enabled in `~/.config/abtop/config.toml`, press
`d` to open the dispatch composer. The composer builds a redacted brief
from the task and your typed instruction, requires a double-Enter
confirmation inside a 5s window, and spawns a one-shot non-interactive
call to the chosen agent. Set `ABTOP_DISPATCH_DRY_RUN=1` to walk the whole
flow without spawning a real child.

Coverage:

- **Claude** — `claude --print` (stdin = brief + draft)
- **Codex** — `codex exec` (best-effort; older Codex builds may exit non-zero)
- **OpenCode** — not wired in the current MVP; see `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`

Dispatch responses are redacted, capped at 256 KB, and saved next to the
audit log; the TUI never renders the response body.

### Roadmap of this surface

What is **in scope today**: read-only task/runtime view, redacted exports,
audited destructive controls (`kill session`, `kill orphan port`),
audited one-shot dispatch composer for Claude/Codex.

What is **deliberately deferred** (per `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`):

- automatic dispatch loops (multi-turn replies driven by abtop),
- direct agent-to-agent private chat,
- keystroke injection into a live REPL,
- cloud/team sync.

## Supported Agents

| Rate Limit        |     ✅      |    ✅     |    ❌    |
| Git Status        |     ✅      |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Children / Ports  |     ✅      |    ✅     |    ✅    |

| Memory Status     |     ✅      |    ❌     |    ❌    |

OpenCode support reads the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (also the default location on Windows; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\opencode` and `%APPDATA%\opencode` are probed as fallbacks) and requires `sqlite3` in `PATH` (on Windows: `winget install SQLite.SQLite`).

## Diagnostics

Run `abtop --doctor` when session discovery, quota display, OpenCode support, tmux jumping, process termination, or port detection does not look right. It checks local-only dependencies and collector prerequisites without reading transcript contents. Use `abtop --doctor --json` in scripts or bug reports; warning-only results exit successfully, while hard collector failures exit non-zero.

## Themes

12 built-in themes, including 4 colorblind-friendly options (`high-contrast`, `protanopia`, `deuteranopia`, `tritanopia`). Press `t` to cycle at runtime, or launch with `--theme <name>`. Your choice is saved to `~/.config/abtop/config.toml`.

## Configuration

`~/.config/abtop/config.toml` supports:

```toml
theme = "btop"
# Hide specific agent CLIs from the TUI (case-insensitive).
# Useful if you only use one agent and want a cleaner view.
hidden_agents = ["codex"]
# Additional Claude Code profile roots to scan.
# abtop also auto-discovers ~/.claude and ~/.claude-* roots that contain
# both sessions/ and projects/.
claude_config_dirs = ["~/.claude-personal", "~/.claude-work-team"]
# UI language. Omit or leave empty to auto-detect from LANG (e.g. "zh").
language = "en"
# Local policy gates for mutating controls.
allow_kill_sessions = true
allow_kill_orphan_ports = true
```

`language` is kept for config-file compatibility. English is currently the supported UI language.

## Library / JSON snapshot

abtop is also a library crate, so local tools can reuse its data-collection
layer in-process — no re-scanning, no subprocesses — and serialize the same
state the TUI renders.

```bash
abtop --json    # one-shot JSON snapshot for scripts
```

For long-running consumers, build an `App`, refresh it with
`App::tick_no_summaries()` (which never spawns `claude --print`, so it doesn't
touch your Claude quota), and call `App::to_snapshot(interval_ms)` to get a
JSON-serializable [`Snapshot`]:

```rust,no_run
use abtop::app::App;
use abtop::{config, theme::Theme};

let cfg = config::load_config();
let mut app = App::new_with_config_and_claude_dirs(
    Theme::default(), &cfg.hidden_agents, cfg.panels, &cfg.claude_config_dirs,
);
app.tick_no_summaries();
let json = serde_json::to_string(&app.to_snapshot(2_000)).unwrap();
```

`App` is not `Send` (it owns the collectors), so keep it on one thread and pass
the serialized JSON elsewhere. [abtop-web-ui](https://github.com/XKHoshizora/abtop-web-ui)
is a reference consumer: a local-first web dashboard built on exactly this API.

## Privacy

abtop reads local files and local process/open-file metadata only. No API keys, no auth. Tool names and file paths are shown in the UI, but file contents are never displayed. Session summaries are generated via `claude --print`, which makes its own API call — this is the only indirect network usage. Prompt text is sanitized and secret-redacted before summary generation, and local fallback titles do not include prompt text. Set `ABTOP_DISABLE_SUMMARIES=1` to skip summary generation and show generic local titles.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to [@tbouquet](https://github.com/tbouquet) for driving much of abtop's recent shape — themes, config overlay and panel toggles, session filtering, subagent tree view, the context window gauge with compaction detection, plus a steady stream of fixes and security hardening along the way.
